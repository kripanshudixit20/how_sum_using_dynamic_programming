# how_sum_using_dynamic_programming
howSum is a function that requires a set of numbers and a targetSum. This function finds how to get the targetSum by adding up the numbers provided in the set of numbers.
For example if targetSum = 7 and set of numbers = [3, 2], then the function will return [3, 2, 2] (because 3 + 2 +2 = 7).
This code uses Dynamic Programming to reduce the amount of time complexity and utilizes the finctionality of LinkedList to reduce the space as well as time complexity.
